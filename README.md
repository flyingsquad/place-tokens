# Place Tokens

This module has two major functions: placing groups of player character tokens on the map, and moving selected tokens to another spot.

## Character Groups

There are two ways to place character groups. 

### Using Group Actors

For DnD 5e and SWADE you can create a Group actor in the Actors tab that lists all the members of the group. Drag and drop the Group actor on the map. Right click the token to bring up the token HUD. Click the Users icon on the left side of the token (multiple people). The Group actor will be replaced with all members of the group.

### Using the Player Characters Folder

First create a folder in the Actors tab. The default name is Player Characters, but you can name it anything you want. If you choose a different name you must set that name in the Player Character Folder setting in the Place Tokens section of the Settings.

To place the group move the cursor to the location on the scene where you want the tokens to appear. Then press the "G" key. You can change this to another key in the Place Tokens section of Configure Controls.
